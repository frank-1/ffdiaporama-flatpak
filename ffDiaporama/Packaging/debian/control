Description: FFDIAPORAMA - Movie creator
ffDiaporama is an application for assembling photos and videos especially
for preserving holiday memories. It is inspired by presentation software
such as Impress or Powerpoint. It can read all image formats, a majority
of cameras and camcorder video formats, and the most commonly used music
formats. It includes 140 transitions and a device database for the
generation of videos with more than 50 models of video viewing devices
(including smartphones, tablets, and home cinema systems).
.
ffDiaporama can manage several hundreds of slides.
Every slide can contain several tens of shots and several tens of blocks.
Every shot contains its own block settings.
The application calculates all the shot transformations.
