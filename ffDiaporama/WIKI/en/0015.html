    <h1>All shots regulations versus current shot regulations</h1>
    <div>There are two types of settings in the 'Image framing and corrections' dialog:</div>
    <ul>
      <li><b>The settings which apply to the current shot.</b> These settings are made shot by shot. So, every shot possesses its own settings and the passage from a shot to the other one is defined by the passage from one setting to an other one creating a shot animation: these are called Ken Burns effects. Here are some some:
        <ul>
          <li>Zoom on a portion of the image</li>
          <li>Scrolling from a portion of the image to an other one</li>
          <li>Clarification or darkening of a portion of the image</li>
          <li>etc...</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><b>The settings which apply to all shots.</b> These settings are made globally, that is their effects will be visible on all the shots of the slide. Here are some some:
        <ul>
          <li>Equalize (Filter of type Equalization of histogram)</li>
          <li>De-speckle (Filter of type Reduction of noise)</li>
          <li>Levels of grey (Passage in black and white)</li>
          <li>Blur/Sharpen</li>
          <li>etc...</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
