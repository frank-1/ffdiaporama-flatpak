      <h2>Principles of functioning </h2>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <div style="text-align: justify;">Slides are shown one after the
          other, in the order in which they appear in the timeline.<br>
          The following diagram symbolizes the principles of functioning
          of slides:<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: center;"><img checked="true" src="../../WIKI_img/Schema.png"><br>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 40px;">The



        slides</h3>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
        On the high part of the diagram are represented slides A, B, C
        and D.<br>
      </div>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">
        <li>Every slide possesses an entering transition (symbolized on
          the diagram by a small square T). The transitions don't have
          all the same duration (symbolized on the diagram by the
          lengths TB ', TC ', etc.): It is indeed possible to define
          slide by slide the duration of the entering transition (either
          to indicate no transition: duration=0).</li>
        <li>Every slide possesses a duration which is appropriate for it
          (symbolized on the diagram by the lengths B ', C ', etc.):
          Some can last only some seconds while the others can last
          several minutes. The durations are expressed in second but are
          not necessarily whole values: A slide can very well last
          12,234 seconds!</li>
        <li>Every slide is a composition. That is an assembly of one or
          several multimedia elements which are livened up in the time.
          The animation in the time is realized through shots.</li>
        <li>Every slide can define a new background (bottom of screen).</li>
        <li>Every slide can define a new musical playlist.</li>
      </ul>
      <div style="margin-left: 120px; text-align: justify;">The slides
        which do not define background, use the background defined in a
        previous slide. So in the following example:</div>
      <ul style="margin-left: 120px; text-align: justify;">
        <li> Slide 1 - Define a background</li>
        <li> Slide 2 - Does not define background and thus uses the
          background defines by the slide 1</li>
        <li> Slide 3 - Does not define background and thus uses the
          background defines by the slide 1 </li>
        <li> Slide 4 - Define a background</li>
        <li> Slide 5 - Does not define background and thus uses the
          background defines by the slide 4<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div style="margin-left: 120px; text-align: justify;"> The same
        principle is applied to the musical playlists. As long as slides
        do not define new playlist, they use the last defined playlist.
      </div>
      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 40px;">Shots



        and blocks<br>
      </h3>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">The low part of the diagram
          represents the slide C.<br>
        </div>
      </div>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">
        <li>Every slide is defined with of 1 in several shots. The shots
          are symbolized on the diagram by rectangles C1, C2, C3, etc.
          &#8230;</li>
        <li>Every shot have its own duration (symbolized on the diagram
          by the lengths C1 ', C2 ', C3 ', etc.). Some shot can last
          only some seconds while the others can last several minutes.
          Some shots can have a duration equal to 0. (The durations are
          expressed in second but are not necessarily whole values: A
          shot can very well last 12,234 seconds!) </li>
        <li>The shots can contain several multimedia objects. The
          multimedia objects are integrated into blocks which can be of
          type title (contain only text), of type images (or photo) or
          of type video.</li>
        <li>The shots are transparent. That is that if the obtained
          image does not fill all the screen, the background (bottom of
          screen) will appear.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Remarks:


        </span><br>
        <ul>
          <li>The shots define the organization of blocks (multimedia
            objects) at the given moment.</li>
          <li>The shots animations are generated by the transformation
            of the organizations from a shot to the other one.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">Concretely,
        if in the foreground, a photo occupies all the screen, then
        occupies only a small part of the screen in the following shot,
        then the animation will consist of the transformation of the
        photo of all the screen (previous shot) towards the small part
        of the screen (following shot).<br>
        <br>
      </div>
      <div style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: justify;">&#160;
        Example:<br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img checked="true" src="../../WIKI_img/Animation_1.png"><br>
        </div>
      </div>
      <ul style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: justify;">
        <li>Shot 1: Image using all the screen: Duration=2 seconds. </li>
        <li>Shot 2: Image using only the bottom right screen quarter:
          Duration 3 seconds. </li>
        <li>Shot 3: Image using again all the screen: Duration=2
          seconds. </li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">
        <li>Result: the photo will be shown on all the screen during 2
          seconds then will be reduced gradually towards the right lower
          quarter of the screen during 3 seconds then will get bigger
          until occupy again all the screen during 2 seconds. <br>
        </li>
        <li>The slide will end as soon as the photo will have reached
          the position defined in the shot 3. <br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Remarks:</span><br>
        <ul>
          <li>The transformations are gradually made: in the example you
            will see the image being gradually reduced.</li>
          <li>The transformations are made during all the duration of
            the following shot.<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        The definition of the objects of every block can vary from a
        shot to the other one: In the following example, are represented
        three different definitions from the same block:<br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img checked="true" src="../../WIKI_img/Animation_2.png"><br>
        </div>
      </div>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">
        <li> 1st shot: The image is full.</li>
        <li> 2nd shot: The image is re-framed on the statue.</li>
        <li> 3rd shot: The image is re-framed on the walkers.</li>
      </ul>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">If we apply
        these definitions like the previous 3 shots:<br>
      </div>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">
        <li>The complete photo will be shown on all the screen during 2
          seconds then will be reduced gradually by zooming on the
          statue towards the right lower quarter of the screen during 3
          seconds then will get bigger until occupy again all the screen
          by moving towards the walkers during 2 seconds.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Remarks:


        </span><br>
      </div>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">
        <li>FfDiaporama can manage up to several hundreds of slides in a
          single project. <br>
        </li>
        <li>Every slide can consist of several (tens) of shots.</li>
        <li>Every slide can contain several (tens) of blocks.</li>
        <li>Blocks can be visible on some shots and invisible on the
          other shots.</li>
      </ul>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">
        <h3>The "Visible" property of blocks and the management of the
          breaks<br>
        </h3>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Blocks have a visible or
          invisible property. In the following example, the image is 3
          times inserted (in 3 blocks) into the same slide.<br>
          <ul>
            <li>The first defined block the whole image filling all the
              screen</li>
            <li>The second defined block the image re-framed on the
              statue and positioned in the form of ellipse in the right
              part of the screen</li>
            <li>The third defined block the image re-framed on the
              walkers and positioned also in the form of ellipse in the
              right part of the screen</li>
          </ul>
          <img alt="" src="../../WIKI_img/Animation_3.png"><br>
          The statue and the walkers have their property positioned on
          invisible on the 1st shot.<br>
          Then the statue becomes visible on the 2nd shot.<br>
          Finally, the statue becomes again invisible on the 3rd shot
          and the walkers become visible.<br>
          <br>
          Result :<br>
          <ul>
            <li>During 2 seconds, the 1st shot is shown and we see only
              the whole image which occupies all the screen</li>
            <li>The second 2 following ones, the statue appears<br>
            </li>
            <li>The next 2 seconds, the statue is replaced by the
              walkers</li>
          </ul>
          This example is really very simple, because it is also
          possible to liven up the appearance and the disappearance of
          blocks.<br>
          Indeed, as evoked previously, the animations of shots are
          generated by the transformation of the organizations from a
          shot to the other one.<br>
          So, if on the 1st shot, the statue occupied the left lower
          small quarter of the screen instead of the same position as on
          the 2nd shot, then instead of appearing simply during 2
          seconds on the 2nd shot, it would appear by getting bigger
          since the left lower small quarter of the screen. <br>
          <br>
          To note that in the case of videos, these are put in break
          when they are invisible.<br>
          So, a video can be display during some seconds in a 1st plan,
          then be set invisible and thus in break in a 2nd shot, then be
          visible on 3rd shot and resume its displaying, there where it
          had stayed in the end of the 1st shot.<br>
        </div>
        <h3>Remark:</h3>
        The total duration of the project is not equal to the sum of the
        slides durations because the transitions make that slides
        overlap: Two slides of 10 seconds with each a transition of 1
        second will give a total duration for the project of 19 seconds
        (and not of 20 seconds)! <br>
