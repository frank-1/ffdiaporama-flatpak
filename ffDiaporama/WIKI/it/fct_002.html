      <h2>Functional principles</h2>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <div style="text-align: justify;">Slides are shown one after
          another, in the order in which they appear in the time line.<br>
          The following diagram shows the principles of functioning of
          slides:<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: center;"><img checked="true" src="../../WIKI_img/Schema.png"><br>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 40px;">The







        slides</h3>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
        On the upper part of the diagram are represented slides A, B, C
        and D.<br>
      </div>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">
        <li>Each slide possesses an entering transition (symbolized on
          the diagram by a small rectangle labelled T). The transitions
          don't all have the same duration (symbolized on the diagram by
          the lengths TA&#8217;, TB', etc.): It is indeed possible to
          define the duration of the entering transition for each slide
          separately (or to indicate no transition: duration=0). </li>
        <li>Each slide possesses a duration which is appropriate for it
          (symbolized on the diagram by the lengths B', C', etc.): Some
          last only a few seconds while others can last several minutes.
          The durations are expressed in seconds but are not necessarily
          whole numbers: a slide mightl last 12.234 seconds! </li>
        <li>Each slide is a composite, an assembly of one or more
          multimedia elements which are animated over time. The
          animation is realized through shots. </li>
        <li>Each slide can define a new background (bottom of screen).</li>
        <li>Each slide can define a new musical play-list.</li>
      </ul>
      <div style="margin-left: 120px; text-align: justify;">Slides which
        do not define a background use the background defined in a
        previous slide. So in the following example:</div>
      <ul style="margin-left: 120px; text-align: justify;">
        <li> Slide 1 - Defines a background</li>
        <li> Slide 2 - Does not define a background and therefore uses
          the background defined by slide 1</li>
        <li> Slide 3 - Does not define a background and therefore uses
          the background defined by slide 1</li>
        <li> Slide 4 - Defines a background</li>
        <li> Slide 5 - Does not define a background and therefore uses
          the background defined by slide 4 </li>
      </ul>
      <div style="margin-left: 120px; text-align: justify;"> The same
        principle applies to the musical play-lists. As long as slides
        do not define a new play-list, they use the last defined
        play-list. </div>
      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%; margin-left: 40px;">Shots







        and blocks<br>
      </h3>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">The lower part of the diagram
          represents the slide C.<br>
        </div>
      </div>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">
        <li>Each slide comprises one or more shots. The shots are
          represented on the diagram by rectangles C1, C2, C3, etc.
          &#8230; </li>
        <li>Each shot has its own duration (symbolized on the diagram by
          the lengths C1 ', C2 ', C3 ', etc.). Some shots can last only
          seconds while others can last several minutes. Some shots can
          have a duration of zero. (The durations are expressed in
          seconds but are not necessarily whole numbers: A shot can very
          well last 12.234 seconds!) </li>
        <li>The shots can contain several multimedia objects. The
          multimedia objects are integrated into blocks which can be of
          three types: title (containing only text), images (or photos),
          or video. </li>
        <li>The shots are transparent. This means that if the image does
          not fill the whole screen, the background (see bottom of
          screen) will appear.</li>
      </ul>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Remarks:






        </span><br>
        <ul>
          <li>The shots define the arrangement of blocks (multimedia
            objects) at any given moment.</li>
          <li>The shot animations are generated by the transformation of
            these arrangements from one shot to another. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">Specifically,
        if in the foreground, an image occupies the whole screen, and
        then occupies only a small part of the screen in the following
        shot, then the animation will consist of the transformation of
        the image of the whole screen (previous shot) into that small
        part of the screen (following shot).<br>
        <br>
      </div>
      <div style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: justify;">&#160;
        Example:<br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img checked="true" src="../../WIKI_img/Animation_1.png"><br>
        </div>
      </div>
      <ul style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: justify;">
        <li>Shot 1: Image using the whole screen: Duration=2 seconds. </li>
        <li>Shot 2: Image using only the bottom right screen quarter:
          Duration 3 seconds. </li>
        <li>Shot 3: Image again using the whole screen: Duration=2
          seconds. </li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">
        <li>Result: the image will be shown on the whole screen for 2
          seconds, will shrink gradually over 3 seconds towards the
          right lower quarter of the screen, and then will grow again
          for 2 seconds until it once more occupies the whole screen. </li>
        <li>The slide will end as soon as the image has reached the
          position defined in shot 3. </li>
      </ul>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Remarks:</span><br>
        <ul>
          <li>The transformations are gradual: in the example you will
            see the image being gradually reduced. </li>
          <li>The transformations are made over the whole duration of
            the following shot. </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        The definition of the objects in each block can vary from one
        shot to another. The following example shows three different
        definitions from the same block:<br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img checked="true" src="../../WIKI_img/Animation_2.png"><br>
        </div>
      </div>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">
        <li> 1st shot: The image is complete.</li>
        <li> 2nd shot: The image is re-framed on the statue.</li>
        <li> 3rd shot: The image is re-framed on the pedestrians.</li>
      </ul>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">If we apply
        these definitions to the previous 3 shots: </div>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">
        <li>The complete image will be shown on all the screen for 2
          seconds, then will be reduced gradually over 3 seconds by
          zooming in on the statue in the right lower quarter of the
          screen, then will grow over 2 seconds until it once more
          occupies the whole screen while moving towards the
          pedestrians.</li>
      </ul>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Remarks:

      </div>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">
        <li>ffDiaporama can manage up to several hundreds slides in a
          single project. <br>
        </li>
        <li>Each slide can consist of tens of shots.</li>
        <li>Each slide can contain tens of blocks.</li>
        <li>Blocks can be visible on some shots and invisible on other.</li>
      </ul>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">
        <h3>The "Visible" property of blocks and the management of the
          breaks<br>
        </h3>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Blocks have a visible/invisible
          property. In the following example, the image is inserted 3
          times (in 3 different blocks) into the same slide.
          <ul>
            <li>The first block defines the whole image filling the
              whole screen </li>
            <li>The second block defines the image re-framed on the
              statue and positioned in an ellipse at the right of the
              screen </li>
            <li>The third block defines the image re-framed on the
              pedestrians and also positioned in an ellipse at the right
              of the screen </li>
          </ul>
          <img alt="" src="../../WIKI_img/Animation_3.png"><br>
          The statue and the pedestrians have their visibility property
          set to invisible on the 1st shot.<br>
          Then the statue becomes visible on the 2nd shot.<br>
          Finally, the statue once more becomes invisible on the 3rd
          shot and the pedestrians become visible.<br>
          <br>
          Result :<br>
          <ul>
            <li>For 2 seconds, the 1st shot is shown and we see only the
              whole image which occupies all the screen </li>
            <li>Over the next 2 seconds, the statue appears </li>
            <li>Over a further 2 seconds, the statue is replaced by the
              pedestrians </li>
          </ul>
          This example is really very simple, because it is also
          possible to animate the appearance and the disappearance of
          blocks.<br>
          Indeed, as shown previously, animations are generated by the
          transformation of the arrangement from one shot to another.<br>
          So, if on the 1st shot, the statue occupied the left lower
          quarter of the screen rather than the same position as on the
          2nd shot, then instead of simply appearing for 2 seconds on
          the 2nd shot, it would appear by growing out of the left lower
          quarter of the screen. <br>
          <br>
          You should note that videos are paused when they are
          invisible.<br>
          Therefore a video can be displayed for several seconds in the
          1st shot, then be made invisible and thus paused in a 2nd
          shot, then be visible in a 3rd shot and resume playing, from
          where it stopped at the end of the 1st shot.<br>
        </div>
        <h3>Remark:</h3>
        The total duration of the project is not equal to the sum of the
        durations of the slides because the transitions make the slides
        overlap: Two slides of 10 seconds, each with a transition of 1
        second, will give a total duration for the project of 19 seconds
        (and not 20 seconds)! </div>
