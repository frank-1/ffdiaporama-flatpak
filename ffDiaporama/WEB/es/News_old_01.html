      <h5>07/27/2011-First beta release</h5>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">First of all, this version
        includes bugs fix and new features:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>A new sheet mode which allows to display several lines in
            the timeline<br>
          </li>
          <li>Drag and drop to reorganize slides</li>
          <li>A new background properties dialog box</li>
          <li>Reset buttons in the framing and image correction dialog
            box<br>
          </li>
          <li>etc...</li>
        </ul>
        Switch to BETA<br>
        <br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">After a while, it is necessary
          to decide to take out a stable version!<br>
          For a long time, the strategy was to say that as long as the
          TODO-LIST would not be emptied, we would continue with alpha,
          but it is necessary to see the evidence: the more we add
          feature and the more we have new ideas and news entered in the
          TODO-LIST. Result: instead of emptying, it fills !<br>
          With this rhythm there, there will be never stable version.
          Thus, to mark a point of stage, we switch to beta!<br>
          <br>
          Concretely, it means:<br>
          <ul>
            <li>There will be no more new feature up to the stable
              version</li>
            <li>The bugg hunting is opened more than ever!</li>
          </ul>
          According to the declarations of buggs, there will be (or not)
          a beta 2. The objective is if possible, to take out the
          (stable) version 1.0 before the end of August.<br>
          <br>
          Thank you in advance in all those who will take time to join
          on the forum and to make declarations of buggs.<br>
          <br>
          I reminder that the forum is also there to exchange between
          users on the software, the features which we would like to see
          adding there, etc....<br>
          <br>
          Today you are approximately hundred to visit this site every
          week and near about forty to download every week the last
          package.<br>
          Today there are only 2 subscribers on the forum???<br>
          <br>
          The success of this beta phase pass by you: We cannot think of
          everything, nor identify all the problems. Please, we do not
          ask you for money, just for your opinion, then, talk to us...<br>

        + some bug fix in particular that under Linux which made confuse
        files .ffd with text files.<br>

        is not still automatic: It is even necessary the 1st time to
        associate manually .ffd with ffDiaporama, but it does not
        perturb any more text editors (gedit, kate).<br>

      <h5>06/06/2011 - Creation of a FORUM (Google discussion groupe)
        for ffDiaporama</h5>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Link : <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ffdiaporama">http://groups.google.com/group/ffdiaporama</a><br>
        <br>

      </div>
      <h5> 06/05/2011 - ffDiaporama 0.99.alpha2</h5>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> The alpha2 release justifies
        itself by the modification of the universe of slides:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>The Alpha1 version (as videoporama) defined slides as
            being an image or a video to which applied a composition
            global</li>
          <li>Every slide consisted of a series of couple of fixed/mobil
            shot.</li>
          <li>Every couple of plan possessed a composition</li>
        </ul>
        In the new universe:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Every slide is defined as being a composition and a series
            of shot</li>
          <li>For every plan of the series we define the properties of
            the blocks of the composition (blocks exist in all the shots
            but can be masked shot by shot)</li>
          <li>The blocks of composition can be of the text, a photo or a
            video</li>
        </ul>
        These major modifications implies a deep modification of the
        interface and the file of data.<br>
        ( Note: sorry but the upward compatibility of the ancient
        savings is not done<br>
        <br>
        Earnings for the interface:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>The interface of edition does not consist more than of the
            only dialogue box of composition.</li>
          <li>This box call up by buttons of edition of text, with
            framming/correction, with filter and video edition</li>
          <li>It becomes much simpler to use</li>
        </ul>
        Earnings features :<br>
        <ul>
          <li>It becomes possible to have several images / video on the
            same slide</li>
          <li>It becomes possible to reduce the display of the images /
            videos: they do not occupy any more necessarily all the
            screen</li>
          <li>It becomes possible to add animations of location of the
            images / videos on the screen (besides the effects burns
            ken)</li>
          <li>It becomes possible to play with the back location
            forward/backward between blocks</li>
          <li>It becomes possible to apply a shape to the images /
            videos (circle, triangle, etc.) while before, only the
            rectangle was possible</li>
        </ul>
        In the days which come, the Web site and the WIKI will be
        completely redone and pages of tutorial presenting these new
        features will make their appearance.<br>
      </div>
      <h5>05/13/2011 - Availability of the fifth version of test </h5>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> The work on blocks started again
        in the composition tabs with the new rotations according to 3

      <h5>04/29/2011 - Availability of a second test version</h5>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Thanks to all those who
        participated in this first test. The numerous bugg report
        allowed to considerably improve the application.<br>
        Do not hesitate to continue the tests with this second available
        version. See Download Page.<br>
      </div>
      <h5>04/25/2011 - Availability of the first test version :
        ffDiaporama 0.99.alpha1</h5>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Having participated in the
        development (in Python) of 2 versions of Videoporama (<a href="http://videoporama.tuxfamily.org/">http://videoporama.tuxfamily.org</a>),
        i decided to begin again a new application (in QT).<br>
        As Videoporama, it is a of creation of videos sequences
        established by : <br>
      </div>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <li>titles, fixed or livened up. </li>
        <li>images or by photos, fixed or livened up.</li>
        <li>movie clip</li>
        <li>music </li>
      </ul>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> These sequences are assembled in
        slide show by means of transitions of sequence to produce
        complete videos<br>
        For ffDiaporama, i resumed most of the features of Videoporama:
        <br>
      </div>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <li>Refocused of images and photos</li>
        <li>Cutting of video clips </li>
        <li>Note (addition of text) for images, photos, sequences and
          animations</li>
        <li>Creation of animation by zoom or Ken Burns Effect on part of
          images or photos</li>
        <li>Transitions between sequence with definition of the
          transition type, sequence by sequence.</li>
        <li>Addition of a background sound (wav, mp3 or ogg) </li>
        <li>Generation of usable videos by most of the current videos
          equipments (DVD player / smartphone, multimedia box, hard
          drive, etc.) but also publishable on the main video sharing
          Web sites (YouTube, Dailymotion, etc.)</li>
        <li>Video format from VGA (640x4800) to Full HD (1920x1080) by
          way of the DVD and HD 720 formats.</li>
        <li>Image geometry (aspect ratio) : 4:3 or 16:9 </li>
        <li>Possible formats of rendering : avi, mpg, mp4, mkv</li>
      </ul>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> And, I took advantage of it to
        add it quite a lot of features which did not still exist, as: <br>
      </div>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <li>Real time preview</li>
        <li>Graphic filters on the images and the videos (passage in
          black and white, dust removal, equalization of colors, etc.)</li>
        <li>Rotation in the animations</li>
        <li>Customizable effects of volume, fade in/out and passage in
          pause, sequence by sequence.</li>
        <li>Image geometry (aspect ratio) 2.35:1 (cinema) </li>
      </ul>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Indeed on, I am always in touch
        with the Videoporama team, and discussions are in progress so
        that my application becomes future version major of Videoporama.<br>
        In the meantime, that is until ffDiaporama become stable, both
        applications are going to continue to live each.<br>
        Today I put on-line the first test version. It stays some more
        of details to be adjusted but the main part of the work is made.<br>
        I shall like very much having your remarks, critics, comments...<br>
        ... And why not your contributions to make out a will,
        translate, inform...<br>
