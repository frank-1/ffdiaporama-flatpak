      <h5>09/11/2011 : Fourth beta release</h5>
      <h5> </h5>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">For this beta fourth, a particular
        effort was made towards the internationalization with the
        addition of Spanish translation (Interface 100% - Wiki 20%) and
        Italian translation (Interface 100% - Wiki 0%).<br>
        <br>
        A the same time, a lot of bug fix :<br>

            pixel in the slide dialog</li>
          <li>A small parasite border appears to the right and below
            around the slide. (Partially fix)</li>

            using KDE [Linux only]</li>
          <li>Main window remains frozen until it is moved or re-sized

        </ul>
      </div>
      <h5>08/26/2011-Fird beta release<br>

      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">And yes, the holidays are finished
        and now here we are with thousands of movies and photos rising.<br>
        To reduce a little the workload which it leads, I propose you a
        new beta version including quite a series of performances
        improvement, for the preview and for the rendering (from 15 % to
        50 % faster according to the composition of the projects).<br>
        <br>
        At the same time:<br>

          <li>Some bug fix</li>
          <li>The last part of the corrections of the English
            documentations. A very very thank you to Hazel Russman who
            correct all my grammatical mistakes in English.</li>
          <li>The addition of many keyboard shortcut</li>
          <li>Some new background in the library<br>
          </li>

      <h5>08/05/2011-Second beta release and holidays<br>
      </h5>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Hi all,<br>
        <br>
        That's it, the long-awaited moment comes finally: I am going to
        leave for vacancy!<br>
        <br>
        Before my holidays, I propose you a last beta version.<br>
        <br>
        It integrates the correction of the last bugs:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Fix the bug of the video player of the edit video dialog
            which stopped alone in a random way.</li>
          <li>Correct some french translation.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Invert play/pause icons in the player.</li>
          <li>Puts back the good titles for buttons to increase/reduce
            thumbnails size and for modes.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Puts back the rendering video buttons in the same order in
            sheet mode as in preview mode.<br>
          </li>
          <li>Fix problem of reading of some .ogg (Vorbis) files.</li>
        </ul>
        It also integrates the first part of the corrections of the
        English documentations.<br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">A very very thank you to Hazel
          who began to correct all my grammatical mistakes in English.<br>
          (And as I am not really good in English, it is an enormous job
          which she is making.)<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        It integrates two new rendering video profiles for Daily Motion
        and YouTube.<br>
        <br>
        Finally, last news: the on-line publishing of a portable version
        of ffDiaporama for <a href="http://www.framakey.org/">Framakey</a>.<br>
        <br>
        At the moment, there is no more opened bug.<br>
        <br>
        If in 2 in 3 weeks which come, no new bug went declared, this
        last beta version will become the first stable version. During
        this time, <br>
        <ul>
          <li>It is likely that Hazel will have ended to correct the
            English documentations - At present near half of the pages
            are already corrected.</li>
          <li>I put on-line in the "<a href="Contribute.html">Contribute</a>"
            page, .ts files for several languages. If certain of you
            have the courage to translate these files (with Qt
            Linguist), it will allow to include additional languages in
            the first stable version.<achecked="true"href="file: home=""

        </ul>
        Thanks to all and good holidays.<br>
